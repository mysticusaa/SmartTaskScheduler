# SmartTaskScheduler 🚀

Welcome to **SmartTaskScheduler**, the intelligent tool designed to turn your "to-do dump" into an actionable, focused plan.

## 🌟 Introduction

SmartTaskScheduler is a productivity tool where you can dump all your todos and actually get them done.

- **Focus Mode:** Features a "Start" button with configurable timers for each task, allowing you to engage in deep work without distractions.
- **Intelligent Rescheduling:** If you don't complete a task, you don't need to manually move it. Our tool automatically reschedules pending items based on **priority**, **deadlines**, and your **available time slots**.

## 🛠️ Setup & Installation

To run this application, you need to start the frontend and backend services separately.

### 🐍 Backend (FastAPI)

The backend is managed using **uv** for fast, reliable dependency management.

1.  **Navigate to the backend directory:**

    ```bash
    cd backend
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    This command will create a virtual environment and install all required packages from your `pyproject.toml`:

    ```bash
    uv sync
    ```

3.  **Start the FastAPI server:**
    ```bash
    uv run uvicorn main:app --reload
    ```
    _The API will be live at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`_

### ⚛️ Frontend (Next.js)

The frontend is a Next.js application managed by **pnpm**.

1.  **Navigate to the frontend directory:**

    ```bash
    cd frontend
    ```

    ```bash
    pnpm install
    ```
